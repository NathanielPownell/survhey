# SurvHey! -- Frontend

This is the client-side of my Survey CRUD application. 🖥️

⚛️ This frontend uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) library along with the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Architecture

Inside [`/src/`](./src/) you will find...

📄[`/pages/`](./src/pages/)

🔩[`/components/`](./src/components/)

The Redux files may be found in [`/features/`]('./src/features/). 

### Styling - CSS + Material UI
This project relies on Material UI for only some of the components. You may notice that each directory in [`/pages/`](./src/pages/) and [`/components/`](./src/components/) has a `css` subdirectory. This is due to using **custom css** for most of the styling.
